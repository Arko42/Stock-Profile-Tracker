Stock Portfolio Tracker
This project is a simple web-based application designed to help users track their stock investments. It allows users to add stocks to their portfolio, view current market values, and see their total gain/loss and return percentage in real-time.

Features
Add Stocks to Portfolio: Easily add stocks by symbol, number of shares, and purchase price.

Real-time Price Updates: Simulates real-time price changes for added stocks (can be extended with actual API integration).

Portfolio Overview: Get a summary of your total portfolio value, overall gain/loss, and return percentage.

Individual Stock Performance: View detailed performance for each stock in your portfolio, including current price, daily change, and individual gain/loss.

Market Status Indicator: Shows whether the market is currently open or closed (simulated).

Persistent Data: Your portfolio data is saved locally in your browser (using localStorage).

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be usable on various screen sizes.

Technologies Used
Frontend ( index.html )
HTML5: Structure of the web application.

CSS3: Styling with a modern, clean design, including responsive layouts.

JavaScript: Core logic for managing the portfolio, updating prices, and handling user interactions.

localStorage: For client-side data persistence.

Intl.NumberFormat: For currency and percentage formatting.

Backend ( app.py )
(Note: The provided app.py is a simplified example. For full functionality, actual API integration would be required.)

Python: Backend language.

Flask: A micro web framework for Python, used for handling API requests.

yfinance: (Example in app.py) A popular library to fetch market data from Yahoo Finance.

alpha_vantage: (Example in app.py) Another library for financial data.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Backend Setup (app.py)
Clone the repository (or download the files):

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>

Install Python dependencies:

pip install Flask yfinance alpha_vantage

Run the Flask backend:

python app.py

The backend will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Frontend Setup (index.html)
The frontend (index.html) is a static HTML file and can be opened directly in a web browser.

Navigate to the project directory.

Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

Note: For the application to fetch real stock prices, you would need to integrate a live stock market API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, Twelve Data) and adjust the frontend JavaScript to make fetch requests to your running backend. The current index.html uses simulated data (stockData object) for demonstration.

Usage
Open index.html in your browser.

Use the "Add New Stock" form to input stock symbols (select from the dropdown), number of shares, and your purchase price.

Click "Add to Portfolio".

Your holdings will appear in the "My Holdings" table, and the "Portfolio Overview" will update.

Click the circular refresh button at the bottom right to manually update prices (simulated in this version).

Future Enhancements
Integrate with a live stock market API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub) for actual real-time data.

Implement user authentication and a database (e.g., Firebase Firestore) for persistent portfolio storage across devices.

Add charting capabilities (e.g., using Chart.js or D3.js) for visual portfolio analysis.

Enable searching for stock symbols directly from an API.

Improve error handling and user feedback for API calls.

Add more sophisticated portfolio analysis metrics.
